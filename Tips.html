     !!!!!! to open report (in the terminal in IDE):
    <br>
    allure serve allure-results
    <br>
    to run API + UI test cases: run file testng.xml
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>


    Part 1
    <br>
    <br>
    OK :

    <br>
    <br>
    1. closeWindow() added
    <br>
    2. project has been restructured: added folder tests for PO tests
    <br>
    3. Jenkins has been installed, allure report plugin has been added to Jenkins
    <br>
    4. run test in testng.xml SmokeTest OK
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    NOK:
    <br>
    <br>

    1. run tests in testng.xml group Regression NOK
    <br>
    2. Allure reports shows only Rest API results, but not also UI test results
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>




    Part 2
    <br>
    <br>

    OK:
    <br>
    <br>
    1. both SmokeTest and Regression test groups run OK<br>
    the problem was in adding 2 groups for each SmokeTest and Regression,<br>
    but must be only 1 group for these test groups, like:<br>
    <br>



    groups
    <br>
    run
    <br>
        include name="SmokeTest"/>
    <br>
        include name="Regression"/>
    <br>
    /run>
    <br>
/groups>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>


    2. both API and UI were not executed, only API after running testng.xml file
    <br>
    the problem was in SearchProductTest.java... files with method main
    <br>
    main method was renamed to testSearchProduct without any arguments
    <br>
    because testNG see only @Test as test methods.
    <br>
    That`s why UI tests with main method were NOT in the Allure report
    <br>
    instead before each UI test was added code:

    <br>
    <br>
    @BeforeMethod(alwaysRun = true)
    public void setUp()

    <br>
    to run opening browser, going to the main page and click Accept button before each UI test

    <br>
    <br>
    Results:

    <br>
    <br>
    1. from running testng.xml file BOTH smoke and regression tests PASSED
    <br>
    2. both API and UI tests are in Allure report
    <br>
