# selenium-java-allure
project for AQA portfolio 

OK: 

1. Rest API tests 
2. UX tests (clicking Accept Cookies button is OK)

NOK (To Be Done): 

1. add @After...? to quit a browser after each test 
2. edit Allure report: 
  2.1. report shows ONLY Rest API test results, NOT BOTH API and UX test results 
  2.2. maybe, add other details about test execution to the report 
  
3. Add project to Docker 
4. Add project to Jenkins 
5. Reformat project structures (variables, reusable code etc.)
